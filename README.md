# Blockyard

A voxel game platform that runs in the browser. The engine gives you a Minecraft-style world that is already built: an endless procedural world, lighting, a shader pipeline, physics, entities, items, combat, audio and UI. A game on top of it is a few small TypeScript files that only describe rules and content: what the launcher shows, what the server and every screen share (the world, blocks, movement), the rules (which run only on the game server), and what each player's screen does.

The compute-heavy work (terrain generation, lighting, meshing, physics, path-finding, projectiles, raycasting, visibility culling and shadow-camera math) is Rust compiled to WebAssembly. three.js on WebGL2 does the rendering, through a custom shader pipeline.

## Games

| Game | URL | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Call of Blocky** | `?game=callofblocky` | A fast free-for-all shooter with a pulp pop-art look, against bots and people. Fight on Jackrabbit Lane, a Nuketown-style cul-de-sac with a burger truck in the middle, a 1950s diner at the end and a storm drain under the street. The weapons are hitscan guns (an AK, a Mac-10 and a drum-fed Tommy gun, a pump shotgun and a sawn-off, a belt-fed machine gun, a semi-auto marksman rifle, a bolt sniper, and the Lucky 45 or a magnum revolver at your side) and a katana; whoever goes down drops a bag of ammo. Right-click aims down the sights, Shift sprints, and C crouches (or slides out of a sprint). You can climb onto ledges, and three- and five-kill streaks earn rewards. Shots are lag-compensated, so what you aim at on your screen is what you hit. Bots fill the street to six. |
| **Arena** | `?game=arena` | Six waves of zombies, skeleton archers, spiders and brutes in a colosseum, then the Warden boss. Weapons drop on the dais between waves: bow, stone/iron/diamond swords, a two-handed pike, battle axe and potions. Online it's co-op: more fighters bring more monsters, each gets their own reward, and anyone who falls sits the wave out. About 640 lines, including the colosseum and the boss AI. |
| **Starfighter** | `?game=starfighter` | A Star Fox-style dogfighter with block-built X-wing, TIE fighter and TIE interceptor. Fight two waves of TIEs over the sea, then take on a 200-block Star Destroyer built into the world: knock out its two shield generators and blow up the bridge. Mouse to fly, W/S boost and brake, Q/E barrel roll (deflects lasers), right-click proton torpedoes. Online it's a squadron: an X-wing each (Red Five, Red Two…), more TIEs for more pilots, and anyone shot down is back in a new ship after 12 seconds. The X-wing is a vehicle (`player.drive`), so it flies at once on your own screen however far away the server is. |
| **Skyship** | `?game=skyship` | Crew an airship across the sky islands and light the five beacons. The airship is a solid prop that sails, turns, banks and bobs, and everyone walks its decks while it does: up to the roof, into the cabin, off onto an island and back aboard. Whoever takes the helm (E at the wheel) steers with W/S, A/D and Space/Shift, and can scroll out to steer from outside. Online, the whole party is the crew. |
| **Bed Wars** | `?game=bedwars` | Hypixel-style Bed Wars on sky islands, against bots or up to three friends (`npm run server -- bedwars`): each player gets their own team, bots play the rest, and someone joining mid-match takes over a bot's team. Collect iron and gold from your generator (diamonds and emeralds on the outer and middle islands), buy blocks, swords, armour, tools, fireballs and team upgrades from the shopkeeper, bridge across the void and break the other beds. You respawn only while your bed stands. The bots fortify, shop, bridge, dig through defences and fight each other as well as you. |
| **Sky Obby** | `?game=obby` | A parkour course of ten stages floating in the sky: stepping stones, a climb, balance beams, posts in a lava lake, crumbling sand, launch pads, red/blue blinking platforms, a spiral tower, a cannon-swept walkway and a leap of faith to the finish. Each player runs on their own clock (it starts when you leave the start island); falling puts you back at your last checkpoint (R does too), and best times go on a leaderboard. The course checks every jump against the player physics as it builds, and a headless bot runs it start to finish. |
| **Sandbox** | `?game=sandbox` | Creative building in an endless world, which the server keeps. |
| **Heart Hunt** | `?game=heart-hunt` | A gentle hunt for ten hidden hearts, and the tutorial game (about 70 lines; see docs/PLATFORM.md). |

The home page lists every game in `src/games/browser.ts`, each on a card with its cover. The pause menu (Escape) has how to play, the settings, an invite link and the way back to the games (and, in a game of your own, a restart).

**To write your own game, read [docs/PLATFORM.md](docs/PLATFORM.md).** In short, a game is a folder of four parts:

```ts
// meta.ts: what the launcher lists
import { defineMeta } from '@platform';
export default defineMeta({ id: 'my-game', title: 'My Game' });

// shared.ts: what the server and every screen read (each screen generates the terrain and predicts its own movement)
import { defineShared, Blueprint } from '@platform';
import meta from './meta';

// A ring wall, stamped into the world during generation.
const ring = new Blueprint({ x: -12, y: 70, z: -12 }, { x: 25, y: 4, z: 25 });
ring.columns(0, 0, 12, (x, z, d) => d > 11 && ring.fill({ x, y: 70, z }, { x, y: 73, z }, 'stone_bricks'));

export const shared = defineShared({
  ...meta,
  world: {
    structures: [ring],
    terraform: [{ x: 0, z: 0, radius: 14, blend: 16, height: 69.5 }],
    spawn: { x: -6, y: 71, z: 0.5 },
    spawnYaw: -Math.PI / 2, // face +x
  },
  player: { health: 20, hotbar: 'items' },
});

// server.ts: the rules, which run only on the game server
import { defineServer, HeldModels, Models, Skins, Behaviors } from '@platform';
import { shared } from './shared';
let won = false;

export default defineServer(shared, {
  setup(game) {
    game.items.define('iron_sword', {
      kind: 'melee', name: 'Iron Sword', icon: 'iron_sword', damage: 6.5, cooldown: 0.42, hold: { model: HeldModels.ironSword },
    });
    // Built-in skins are just the player's; bring your own with game.items.atlas (see the docs).
    game.entities.define('rogue', {
      name: 'Rogue', model: Models.humanoid({ skin: Skins.player }), hitbox: { width: 0.6, height: 1.95 },
      health: 20, speed: 3.2, ai: Behaviors.melee({ damage: 3 }),
    });
  },
  start(game) {
    won = false;
    game.player.inventory.give('iron_sword');
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) game.entities.spawn('rogue', { x: 8, y: 71, z: i * 2 - 2 });
  },
  update(game) {
    if (!won && game.entities.count('rogue') === 0) {
      won = true;
      game.hud.screen({ title: 'You win!', tone: 'victory', buttons: [{ label: 'Again', primary: true, onClick: () => game.restart() }] });
    }
  },
});

// client.ts: each player's screen
import { defineClient } from '@platform/client';
import { shared } from './shared';
export default defineClient(shared);
```

Then list it in `src/games/browser.ts` (its meta, and its client loaded on demand) and `src/games/server.ts` (its server part).

## Run it

Prerequisites: Rust (stable) with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, and Node 20 or newer. `wasm-pack` is installed as a dev dependency.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
npm install
npm run dev        # builds the wasm engine, then runs a local game server and Vite on http://localhost:5173
```

Every game is played on a game server, alone or together. `npm run dev` runs one in development mode next to Vite (on port 8787, `--server-port` to change it; `--port` for Vite's), and the page connects to it: cheats are on, the development games open by id (`?game=gallery`), and in the browser's console `await __game.dev('game.players.length')` runs code in the game's room on the server (`game` is its `GameContext`, `me` your own player). See [Running and debugging](docs/PLATFORM.md#running-and-debugging).

Other scripts:

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Release wasm build, type-check, the boundary check, a production bundle in `dist/`, and the bundle check (no server code in it). Set `VITE_GAME_SERVER=wss://…` for the server the site plays on |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production bundle |
| `npm run wasm` | Rebuild only the Rust engine (`engine/pkg`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript and the boundary check (`npm run check:boundaries`: games, kits and each side of the client / server split keep to their imports) |
| `npm run test:engine` | Rust unit tests: generation, blueprints, meshing, lighting, culling, physics, entities, path-finding, textures |
| `npm run test:headless` | Games in Node, no browser (`tests/headless`): every game runs 30 s, a bot beats the Arena, bots play out a Bed Wars match, several players share a host and a real server. About 8 s in total |
| `npm run server -- [games…] --port 8787` | Host games (all of them by default, each at `ws://localhost:8787/<game>`); players open `/?server=ws://localhost:8787&game=sandbox`. `--dev` is development mode, as `npm run dev` runs it. Match games (Bed Wars, Arena, Starfighter) also offer a game of your own (`&room=<code>`), each game running in a worker thread of its own (`--rooms 8` at once). Each game's world, players' places and data are kept in `data/<game>.sqlite` (`--data dir`, `--new` for fresh worlds, `--cheats` for developer commands) |
| `npm run build:server` / `npm start` | Bundle the game server (games included) into `dist-server/` / run it with plain Node |
| `npm run deploy:server` | Deploy the game server to Fly.io (`fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`) |
| `npm run deploy:site` | Build the site pointed at the game server (`GAME_SERVER`, default the Fly app) and deploy it to Vercel |

URL parameters: `?game=<id>` picks a game. `?server=ws://host:port` picks the game server (by default the one the site was built with, or in development the local one), and `&room=<code>` a game of one's own on it. The server picks the world's seed (`npm run server -- --seed 1234`).

## Online

The site is at **https://blockyard.potrock.xyz** (also https://blockyard-games.vercel.app) and the game server at **https://voxel-games.fly.dev** (`/games` lists what's on and who's playing). The site is online-only: the home page shows the game live, and **Play** joins it under the name you type.

- **Game server:** Fly.io app `voxel-games` in `iad`, one machine (shared CPU, 512 MB) that sleeps when nobody's connected and wakes on the next visit, with a 1 GB volume at `/data` for the SQLite worlds (snapshotted daily). `fly logs -a voxel-games` shows joins, leaves and game errors. Public servers run without cheats: developer commands (`cheat: true`) don't exist, and players can't restart the game for everyone or change the time. Each game starts when its first player arrives and is saved and stopped five minutes after its last leaves. Limits: 16 players per game, 6 connections per address, 300 messages a second per connection, 16 KB per message; every message is checked before the game sees it.
- **Website:** Vercel project `voxel-platform` (Pat's projects), a static build made locally (Vercel's builders don't have Rust) with `VITE_GAME_SERVER` baked in, which is what makes the site connect to the server.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| WASD | Move |
| Space | Jump. In Sandbox, double-tap to toggle flight and hold to rise while flying |
| Shift | Sneak (won't walk off edges). Descend while flying |
| Ctrl or double-tap W | Sprint |
| Left mouse | Attack; hold to draw a bow (Arena, Bed Wars). Break a block (Sandbox); hold to mine one (Bed Wars). Fire (Call of Blocky) |
| Right mouse | Use: drink a potion (Arena), eat, throw a fireball (Bed Wars). Place a block (Sandbox, Bed Wars). Open the shop by right-clicking the shopkeeper (Bed Wars). Aim down the sights (Call of Blocky) |
| Shift, C, R, L, Tab | Call of Blocky: sprint; crouch, or slide out of a sprint; reload; choose your primary; the scoreboard |
| Middle mouse | Pick block (Sandbox) |
| 1-9, mouse wheel | Select hotbar slot. At Skyship's helm, the wheel zooms out to third person |
| E | Block picker (Sandbox) |
| F | Toggle flight (Sandbox) |
| Mouse, W/S, Q/E, A/D, RMB | Starfighter: steer, boost/brake, barrel roll, bank, torpedo |
| `/` or T | Command bar: `/give pike`, `/spawn zombie 3`, `/tp ~ ~10 ~`, `/time noon`, `/heal`, `/kill`, `/fly`, `/help` (Tab completes) |
| Esc | Pause, settings, restart, exit |
| F1 / F3 | Hide HUD / debug overlay |
| `[` / `]` | Shift time by one hour (Sandbox) |

Moving, jumping, crouching and sprinting can be rebound under **Keyboard** in the pause menu: click a key, then press the new one. Taking a key another control uses swaps the two (Sprint on Shift puts Crouch on Ctrl), and the bindings are kept in the browser with the other settings. They start from each game's own keys (Call of Blocky sprints on Shift and crouches on C) and follow the player from game to game. Every game sees a rebound key as the one it replaced, so nothing in a game changes.

```

**Simulation and client are separate.** The `Sim` (`src/platform/sim`) runs the game: the game's own code, players, entities, items, combat and block edits. It touches no DOM and no WebGL, and talks to the client only in plain data. Each tick it takes a `PlayerInput` snapshot per player and produces a `SimFrame` (positions, poses, health, hotbars, pickups, props). HUD, effects and sound calls become `PresentCall` messages addressed to one player or to everyone. Menu and button callbacks become ids that come back as `ClientMessage`s. A `GameHost` (`src/platform/host`) runs the `Sim` on its own copy of the world, generated around the players, and answers each tick with a batch: content definitions, presentation calls, block edits, then the frame. It runs on the game server (`npm run server`, or `npm run dev` in development), for one player or many over WebSockets, so game logic, physics and path-finding never compete with rendering and a game's rules never reach the browser: the page is only the client (camera, views, presenter, rendering, and prediction of its own player), its world mirrors the host's edits, and it loads each game's client code only when that game is picked. In Node the same `GameHost` runs headless for tests. On the engine side, the simulation core (`gen.rs`, `world.rs`, `entities.rs`, `blocks.rs`) is plain Rust with no wasm-bindgen types, so a native build generates identical worlds from the same seed and blueprints. See [docs/PLATFORM.md](docs/PLATFORM.md#architecture-and-the-road-to-multiplayer).

**Threads.** Terrain generation and meshing run in a pool of Web Workers (hardware threads minus two). They share one `WebAssembly.Module` that is compiled once on the main thread. The main thread keeps its own wasm instance holding the authoritative block data and entity state. Physics, raycasts, edits, entity simulation and per-frame culling all use it synchronously.

**Chunks.** Columns are 16×16×256 and stored sparsely as 16³ sections. Generation is stateless: `(seed, cx, cz)` plus the game's blueprints fully determines a chunk. Trees that cross chunk borders are placed from a margin, so both chunks agree without talking to each other. Game structures (`Blueprint`s) are stamped by the workers during generation, so they cost nothing at runtime and survive chunk reloads.

**Lighting.** Sky light and block light are computed per mesh job with a BFS over the 3×3 column neighbourhood. Light 15 dies out within 15 steps, so that neighbourhood contains every source that can reach the centre column. The result is exact and seamless without any global light storage. An edit only remeshes the columns within light range, and all of them swap in the same frame.

**Meshing.** Opaque faces are greedy-merged when their smooth lighting and ambient occlusion are uniform. Other faces keep per-vertex AO and light, with the quad diagonal flipped to avoid AO anisotropy. There are three layers: opaque, cutout (leaves, plants, glass) and translucent (water). Each vertex packs into 8 bytes (`uvec2`), and texture coordinates are derived in the shader. One shared index buffer serves every mesh.

**Culling.** Meshes are stored section by section, so the visible part of a column is always one contiguous draw range. Each frame, wasm runs frustum culling per section plus a Minecraft-style cave-culling BFS through section connectivity graphs (computed by the mesher). The result drives three.js `drawRange` and `visible` directly. The shadow pass gets its own caster selection.

**Entities.** Up to 160 bodies and 320 projectiles live in flat buffers in wasm memory. Each frame Rust steps all of them at once: substepped AABB physics against the voxel world, auto-step, knockback, separation, line of sight, and ballistic projectiles with hit detection. A 97×28×97 flow field toward the player is rebuilt four times a second. It handles walls, steps and drops, and every chasing mob steers down it. TypeScript runs the behaviours (state machines on the public `Entity` API) and drives box models that use the Minecraft skin UV layout.

**Rendering (WebGL2 via three.js):**
- Physically based sky: Rayleigh, Mie and ozone single scattering with a multiple-scattering term, rendered into a small LUT that the sky, fog and reflections all sample.
- Sun and moon, rotating stars, a Milky Way band, and procedural clouds that cast moving shadows.
- Cascade-free stable shadow map (texel-snapped, rotated Poisson PCF) with normal-offset bias. Mobs, items and arrows cast shadows too.
- Smooth lighting and AO, normal maps and specular from generated material textures, and emissive blocks. Entities sample the voxel light field through a Rust light probe, so a zombie in a tunnel is dark and one next to a torch is lit.
- Waving leaves and grass. Foliage lets light through, and alpha-to-coverage keeps it sharp.
- Water: screen-space reflections, refraction with Beer-Lambert absorption, a sun glint, shoreline foam, a Snell's-window view from below, and caustics plus softened shadows on underwater floors.
- A first-person view built from Minecraft's own transforms: a skinned arm, the bow's draw pose and the post-attack dip. Swords, axes, potions and polearms are real 3D block models gripped in the hand, with a diagonal slash, an overhead hew, a sip and a two-handed jab; other items are extruded sprites. Walk bob, look sway, a landing dip and recoil on top. Games can add their own held models, grips and keyframe animations.
- Movable block builds ("props", like the Starfighter ships): a Blueprint meshed once with the world's block textures, AO, shadows and glowing blocks, then moved freely every frame. glTF and GLB models (Blockbench, Blender) as props, animated figures (idle, walk in step, run, attack, a head that looks), player models and held items with drawn icons, lit and shadowed like everything else. Glowing laser bolts, explosions (fireball, smoke, sparks, shockwave) and `world.explode` craters.
- Additive FX (pickup beams, shockwaves, glows), a particle system, floating damage numbers and screen shake.
- HDR with MSAA, bloom (13-tap down / tent up), screen-space god rays, ACES tone mapping and underwater fog.

**Assets.** None. All the block textures, the player skin, the starter item sprites and the sound effects are generated procedurally: textures in Rust, sounds with WebAudio. Games bring their own art and sounds the same way: the Arena paints its mobs and weapons in TypeScript (`src/games/arena/art/`) and synthesises its creature voices (`sounds.ts`); Starfighter builds its ships from blocks and synthesises its lasers.

## Performance notes

Measurements are on an Apple M2 Max at 1600×900 with the default settings (12 chunks, 4× MSAA, 3072² shadows).

- **Sandbox:** the main thread spends about 2 ms per frame, rendering about 600 draw calls and 0.7 M triangles. A worker job takes about 1.4 ms to generate a chunk and about 1.1 ms to light and mesh one. At 20 chunks (about 1,300 columns) the world streams in within about 5 s and stays at 60 fps.
- **Arena:** a full six-wave run holds 60 fps with 12+ mobs, arrows and fireballs in flight, at about 1–2 ms of CPU per frame.

The settings menu has shadow quality, resolution scale, MSAA and per-effect toggles for slower GPUs.
