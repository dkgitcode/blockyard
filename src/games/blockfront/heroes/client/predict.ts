 * Our own saber, at once: the swings of the combo and the guard shown on our figure (and our

 * server's word comes back. It runs the combo as the server's saber does (`saber.ts`: the same
 * timings, `tuning.ts`), from our own controls; the damage stays the server's.
 *
 * The server still tells everyone of each swing (`bfh.swing`). Ours come back to us: each is
 * taken as the confirmation of the oldest swing we guessed (in order), and if the server's swing
 * is another of the combo than we guessed, the swing on show takes its step (from then on we
 * follow the server's combo). A guess the server never confirms (it refused: our hands were busy,
 * we were parried) is dropped, the figure easing back to its stance. A swing of ours the server
 * started that we didn't guess is shown when it comes. Our guard goes up and down with our own
 * RMB; the server's word on it only matters when it breaks, or we're staggered.
