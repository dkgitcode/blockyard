/**
 * Ammo bags (a scavenger for everyone): whoever goes down drops one where they fell. Walking over
 * one tops up the spare rounds of every gun you carry to what you came in with (the magazines as
 * they are), so you can keep shooting without dying. A bag's used up by whoever touches it first,
 * full up or not, and it's gone after `LIFE` seconds. Bots low on rounds go and get the nearest
 * (`bots.supplies`). Someone whose primary runs out of spare rounds is told where more come from,
 * once each time it does.
 *
 * Its look (an ammo can, `models/ammo.glb`) and its voice (`ammo`) are each screen's.
