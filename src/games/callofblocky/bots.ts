 * Bot fighters: the platform's shooter bots (`shooterBots`, whose defaults are tuned to how they
 * fight here), told how each of our weapons is fought with. They hold the range their gun likes,
 * rush in with the shotguns and SMGs, stay down the scope with Ezekiel and the Honey Bunny, and go
 * to their sidearm when the primary runs dry up close. When someone they were fighting ducks out of sight, they
 * lob their lethal after them (the better ones cook a frag first).
 *
 * What they're after is the mode's (`rules`, set by the server for each match): who's fair game
 * (everyone in a free-for-all, the other side in a team mode), and where to go when nobody's in
 * sight (the briefcase when it's out on the street, the better ones more often; in The Briefcase,
 * the sites, the case and its carrier; the nearest ammo bag when they're low on rounds).
 * Otherwise they roam the map's walking grid (`nav`, the map being played) toward its hotspots.
