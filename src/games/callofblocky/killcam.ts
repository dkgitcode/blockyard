/**
 * The kill cam: shot by someone, you see it again through their eyes (the platform's replays,
 * `game.replay`): the last few seconds up to the shot that got you and a moment after, with their
 * hands and their gun, then you respawn. Your own death is never shown from your side of it.
 *
 * The timing, from the moment you die:
 * - 0 to 0.5 s: you fall (the death tilt) and KILLED BY comes up;
 * - 0.5 s: the kill cam starts, 4 s long (from 3.5 s before the death to 0.5 s after), at full speed;
 * - 4.5 s: it's over and you respawn (the respawn delay was 3 s: it stretches by 1.5 s).
 *
 * Killed by a killstreak (the Hellstorm, the chopper), it's seen from a camera standing near
 * where you fell instead (`Streaks.killcamView`).
 *
 * Skipping it (click or Space, `client/killcam.ts`) respawns you at once if the old 3 s are up,
 * else when they are (watching whoever did it meanwhile). Bots get no kill cam, and respawn as before.
