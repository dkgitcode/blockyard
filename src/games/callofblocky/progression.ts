/**
 * XP, levels and unlocks: everything a person earns on Jackrabbit Lane, kept by name in the
 * server's database (`game.store`, `xp:<name>`), so it follows them across matches, rooms and
 * restarts. Only the server awards XP, only while a match is on, and only to people: bots are
 * never limited and never earn anything (a bot killing a bot is worth nothing to anyone).
 *
 * Own rooms (`instances`) count too: they share the game's store with the public room, and a game
 * can't tell them apart. So what can be farmed there is kept small: the time bonus only counts
 * minutes someone fired in, the placing bonus needs a minute in the match and a shot fired, and
 * kills on the same person past the fifth in a match are worth half.
 *
 * Guests (no name typed: "Player", "Player 2"…) share one name, so they earn XP for the session
 * only and start again at level 1 next time; so does any brand-new name.
 *
 * The rules' hooks (server.ts): `setupProgression(game)` in `setup` (before the game's own
 * `playerDeath` listener, so the kill that ends a match still counts), `matchStart()` in `start`,
 * `matchOver(results)` when a match ends, `gate` and `outfits` in the loadout menu, `outfitFor` when
 * someone joins. Everything else it hears for itself (`playerDeath`, `playerDamage`, `pickup`,
 * `shot`). Each screen draws it (`client/progression.ts`): the bar and badge, the ticker of gains,
 * the level-up, the match's XP; this sends them what to show, and nothing else.
