/**
 * The arsenal. Everyone carries a primary and a sidearm of their choosing and the Hattori katana.
 * Numbers are tuned for 100 health: most guns kill in three to five body shots, heads take fewer,
 * the katana, the Honey Bunny and Rock Salt (up close) in one, Bad Mother in two.
 *
 * The primaries: the Big Kahuna (an all-rounder), two SMGs (the Mac-10, quick and light; the
 * Wolf, a Tommy gun with a fifty-round drum, heavier to swing), two shotguns (Zed's Pump; Rock
 * Salt, a sawn-off with both barrels one after the other and then a reload), Marsellus (a
 * machine gun: a hundred-round belt, slow to aim and to reload), and two scoped rifles (Ezekiel,
 * semi-automatic, three to the body; the Honey Bunny, a bolt gun, one). The sidearms: the Lucky
 * 45, quick and steady, or Bad Mother, a magnum revolver that kicks.
 *
 * Every bullet chips the walls (`carve`): a pit `radius` round, and each shot on the same spot
 * goes about `radius + depth` further in. Through a block-thick wall that's about eight rifle or
 * pistol shots, ten from the SMG, two from the Honey Bunny; the shotgun's pellets pepper it.
 *
 * The rifles, Marsellus, the pistols and the Honey Bunny wall-bang (`penetration`): the rifle
 * through a block-thick wall head on (at about two thirds of its damage), Marsellus and Ezekiel a
 * little more, the pistols only through thinner stuff (a wall already shot into, a slab, a door),
 * the Honey Bunny through two blocks and still a kill up close.
 *
 * And a lethal (G): the Pineapple, a frag that bounces and rolls and blows a crater in a wall,
 * or the Mia, a five-dollar shake bottle full of fuel that breaks where it lands and burns.
 *
 * This is what they do. How they look and sound (their models and icons, where they sit in first
 * person, tracers, trails, their voices) is each screen's: `client/looks.ts`.
