/**
 * Bot fighters for a shooter. Each drives a real player through its keyboard and mouse
 * (`bot.controls`), so it moves, aims and fires by the same rules a person does: it looks around,
 * spots whoever's in view (through a hole in a wall too), reacts after a beat, swings its aim on
 * (never perfectly), fires (bursts from an automatic, a shot at the gun's pace from anything
 * else), strafes, holds the range its gun likes, reloads, switches guns, and otherwise roams the
 * walking grid (`navGrid`) toward where it last saw someone or heard a shot, or somewhere worth
 * being. How good each one is comes from its skill (0..1); the game says how its weapons are
 * fought with and adds its own rules through hooks (an objective, a pickup, a dodge, a grenade).
 *
 * Built only on the public API, so copy it into your game and change anything.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const nav = navGrid(game, { bounds: MAP.bounds });
 * const bots = shooterBots(game, { nav, hotspots: MAP.hotspots, weapons: { rifle: { range: 16 }, shotgun: { range: 4, ads: false, rush: true } } });
 * game.events.on('playerJoin', ({ player }) => player.bot && bots.add(player as Bot, game.rng.range(0.3, 0.8)));
 * // update: bots.update(dt, phase !== 'playing');   after a respawn: bots.reset(player);
 * ```
